# 5/10/21 - Package structure
## Context and Problem Statement

We need a system to handle our node packages and their dependancies

## Considered Options

* Consolidated package.json
* Multi system (additional package.json files for frontend and backend)

## Decision Outcome

We used the multi system to allow backend to operate independantly from front end.
