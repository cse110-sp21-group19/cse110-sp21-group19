# 5/10/21 - Data Storage

**Updated 5/13/21 - This decision has been removed as we have moved to a Local APP**

We wanted to look into data storage options and how we would use them with respect to the app

## Options Considered
- Local Storage - Store locally as a json
- mySql - Use outside provider and work with their api
- MongoDB - Use outside provider and work with their api


## Settled Option
We settled on using SQl. The main reason is because our group is not very experienced when it comes to databases, and everyone was open to all three options. However, one of our leads were a little familiar with Sql and as a result, the group did settle on using Sql.
