# 5/11/21 - Unit Test Tooling
## Context and Problem Statement

The team has a need for a robust testing suite to ensure our web app functions correctly.

## Considered Options

* Jest
* Mocha

## Decision Outcome

We decided to go with Jest since some members have prior experience, quick set up, support for UI testing, coverage reporting and support from CSE 110 staff via labs.
