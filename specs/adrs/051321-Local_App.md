# 5/11/21 - Web Component Decision

## Context and Problem Statement

The team wanted to clarify whether or not the the app would be online or local. Making it online would allow for more cross device compatibility, but leave the app open to cyber attacks. Making it local would allow for less concern with security, but make it hard for cross device compatibility.

## Considered Options

* Local App (Like the Labs)
* Online App (Like Facebook / Twitter)

## Decision Outcome

We decided to go with a local app. The reason for this is because we wanted to be more in line with with the scope of the project. It felt like making the app work online would invite a slew of problems that would be extremely difficult to solve with the current time table.
