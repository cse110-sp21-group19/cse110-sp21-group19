# 5/10/21 - Google Login

**Updated 5/13/21 - This decision has been removed as we have moved to a Local APP**


Our team is concerned with the security of login and how to support multiple users. 

## Options Considered
- Local identification
- Google / External tool
- No identification


## Settled Option
We settled on Google. Although the team understands that there is a heavy learning curve, we wanted to be able to securely log users in. We want to allow users to feel like their information is not at risk.
