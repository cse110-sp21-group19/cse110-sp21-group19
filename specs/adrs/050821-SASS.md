# 5/8/21 Determing CSS Files

Our team is familiar with css files, but one of our more experienced Web Designers is more experienced with SASS, so frontend decided how to make their css files

## Options Considered
- Raw CSS
- SASS - Write with the syntax of SASS and have it compile to css files

## Settled Option
As the experience for the frontend dev team is similar for css and one is more familiar with working with SASS, the dev team decided that it made more sense to settle on the strengths of experience and decided on using SASS.
