# 5/25/21 - Code Quality Tooling
## Context and Problem Statement

The team has a need for to quickly review the quality of the code as a whole on an more abstract level (looking at the overall logic compared to just linting).

## Considered Options

* Codacy
* Codeclimate

## Decision Outcome

We decided to go with Codacy as it allowed us to use a very easy to integrate system with a nice UI that provided all the important information quickly and gave trends over time. Codeclimate seemed more focused on the logistics of issues to commits to PRs to merges which is something we deemed overkill for our team size. Codacy also provided integrated linting for various other file types that we didn't initially consider (sass, css).
