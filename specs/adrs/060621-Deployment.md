# 5/25/21 - Deployment
## Context and Problem Statement

The team needs to be able to deply our app online.

## Considered Options

* Github Pages
* Heroku

## Decision Outcome

We decided to go with Github pages for it's frictionless use and support given through the class's labs. Heroku would've been nice but it would have needed a lot more time to learn how to code a local server and integrate it with Heroku. It is likely that Heroku would've transitioned to Heroku later on.
