    - Every sprint had something done
    - Consistent standups for all members
    - Good Momentum sprint to sprint
    - Strong communication in Retrospectives
  - Challenges
    - we made many changes, but these changes took a while to be merged into main. A majority of these merges happened in the last 2 weeks. We also abandoned old merges in favor of newer merges because the newer merges had the most updated code
    - Didn't split issues into small enough issues, teams had to create their own sub issues to show progress
    - Issues were given out of order which led to a messy workflow
