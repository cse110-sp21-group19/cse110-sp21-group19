### What We Did
Frontend

    - Adding a weekly nav template 
    - Can have 
  - Manda
    - Importing / Applying icon styling with Shadow DOM

    - Adding Entries into the additional entries
  - Considerations for Design
    - pushing to other logs
    - Styling might be a concern
    - Do future deadlines go onto future dates
Backend
- API - no significant changes
- [Google Accounts](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in)
  - What Frontend has to do - passing an identifier
  - Saving Users to the DB
    - Chris has an idea --> write about how that connects to the DB in a readme file
- Database
  - Locally --> Doc for setting up
  - TypeORM
    - Basic intialized structure
  - Garvin and Chris -- brief experience
  - File Structure
    - Index --> API | Model | Repository
      - API - API code
      - Model - Structure for Tables
      - Repository - Interactions with the SQL DB
    - Frontend --> uses API --> Changes to the REPO
  - 2 Scripts
    - Initialize -- Populate the DB
    - Runs API -- Listening for any calls to the API
Names

### Points of Action
Front End
- Daily Log Skeleton - limited implementation, all components are there and working, limited styling -- EOD Friday 5/14
Back End
- Bullet Association (Nested Bullets)
- Finalize DB structure
- Making sure Garvin and Chris are caught up with Database knowledge, on everyone's machine -- EOD Friday 5/14 
Builder
- Working with Testing and Docs to add to CI/CD Pipeline
- Automate Pull Requests

Testing
