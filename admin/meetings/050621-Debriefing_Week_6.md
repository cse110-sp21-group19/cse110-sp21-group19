### What We Did
- **Frontend Discussion**
  - Can get disorganized pretty quickly --> web components / modules?
  - Styling gets "shoved" into each component
  - Familiarity with JS
  - Issue: Changing Bullet Items --> Manda/Malhar has a solution
  - Issue: Does Markdown work? --> Pre-existing code to convert
  - Authentification: Maybe simpler than Google API
- **Designer Discussion**
  - Link to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/LQM1jDij3vh8H6SmoQD9t9/BuJu-Draft?node-id=35%3A0)
  - Edit Button? --> it applies to the main note
  - Additional Entries --> scroll down by page
  - Additional Entries Sort --> by recency (top left is the most recent)
  - No additional Entries --> main note portion fills the page
  - Can Mark (completed, important, strikethrough) in "read-only" mode
  - 2 modes: Edit Mode (Add more "words") -- Accessed from edit button / Read Mode (Interact with bullets) -- click off edit mode
  - Main text area -- Like a document? 
    - ~~can take plaintext~~ / automatically add default type ("- Note")
  - Main section --> similar to demos
  - Additional entires --> doc style
  - Click on Additional entry --> brings up a pop-up style thing for the additional entry (maybe expand?)
  - Additional Entry box --> title / preview / media preview / full
    - probably title + date
- **Backend Discussion**
  - Link to [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13vq25D-qup2cG91aC82-njmaQDTNEOMQUmc0ZeJflzU/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Is there a need to delete a user? Maybe --> clear data (privacy concerns)
  - Settings (2-3, most likely less than 5)

- **App Type**
  - Electron intro --> would we want to make it a desktop app?
    - Steeper learning curve --> with time frame, if manageable, then maybe - not a priority
    - Prioritize Web --> time permitting (mobile webpage -> desktop)

- **Linting, NPM, File Structures**
  -
