## Understanding iNeedA\<br>
iNeedA\<br> (Group) is founded on the belief that everyone is an ally to everyone else. We value phycological safety and promote an environment where people are able to present ideas and expect to be given constructive criticism. We value individuals who are open about their struggles, are not shy about asking for help, and are constantly improving through constructive criticism.
