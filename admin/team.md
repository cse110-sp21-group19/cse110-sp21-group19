### About Us
We're a group of 10 students gathered to build something together. We consist of students in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year @ UCSD. We are mentored by Sasya Reddi.

Internally, we strive to promote high psychological safety within this group by maintaining a open mind philosophy and recognizing both our team's strengths and limitations. 
In our project, we aim to bring a minimalist approach where we prioritize user accessibility.

<!--- Include Branding (Mascot/colors/etc.) when that's finalized --->
