### About Us
We're a group of 10 students gathered to build something together. We consist of students in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year @ UCSD. We are mentored by Sasya Reddi.

We strive to promote high psychological safety within this group and will do everything possible in order to realize this reality.
