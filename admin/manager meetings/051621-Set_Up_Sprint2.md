### Points of Action
Q's for Sasya
- What is a local app and how does Backend interact with it? We would like a clear definition. 
- Is there a rubric / other resource that we can use to gauge where we are at?

Status Video
- App so far - do my own quick demo of frontend
- Backend's API - scroll through the API doc
- Pipeline - show that github actions work
- Future Plans
  - Design's styling -- figma
  - testing / doc generation added to pipeline
- health of the team
  - Show off retrium stuff
  - So far so good, some administrative frustration, but we hope to fix these in Sprint 2
